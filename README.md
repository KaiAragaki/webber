Webber is my assistant to help me manage and edit my blots and their
metadata. It does this by providing a suite of tools to help edit and
download data, as well as by enforcing a documentation format that makes
automated annotation (and querying) easy.

## Installation

You can install the development version of webber like so:

``` r
# devtools::install_github("KaiAragaki/webber")
```
